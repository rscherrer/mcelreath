#### Exercise 2M3 ####

# Proportion of water on Earth and Mars
pwaters <- c(earth = 0.7, mars = 0)

# Probability of samping "land" in one draw under the two models
likelihoods <- dbinom(0, 1, prob = pwaters)

# Equal priors

# Compute the posterior
posteriors <- likelihoods * priors
posteriors / sum(posteriors)

# Indeed 0.23 for Earth



#### Exercise 2M4 ####

# Priors once we know a black side has been drawn
priors <- c(bb = 1/2, bw = 1/2, ww = 0)

# Probabilities of black sides for each card
pblacks <- c(bb = 1, bw = 0.5, ww = 0)

# Probabilities of drawing one black side for each card (= pblacks cause 1 draw)
likelihoods <- dbinom(1, 1, prob = pblacks)

# Probabilities to draw a second black given we already have one
posteriors <- likelihoods * priors
posteriors / sum(posteriors)

# The probability that the other side of the black-sided card on the table
# is also black is 2/3

#### Exercise 2M5 ####

# Same but with one extra bb card in the deck

# Priors once we know a black side has been drawn
priors <- c(bb = 2/3, bw = 1/3, ww = 0)

# Probabilities of black sides for each card
pblacks <- c(bb = 1, bw = 0.5, ww = 0)

# Probabilities of drawing one black side for each card (= pblacks cause 1 draw)
likelihoods <- dbinom(1, 1, prob = pblacks)

# Probabilities to draw a second black given we already have one
posteriors <- likelihoods * priors
posteriors / sum(posteriors)

# Now the probability is 80%

#### Exercise 2H1 ####

# T = having one twin
# T2 = having another pair of twins
# Species A or B
#
# P(T2|T) prob that the female has another pair of twins given already one
# = P(T|A) P(A|T1) + P(T|B) P(B|T1)
# in other words, prob that female has twins given she is A, times the prob that
# she is A given she had already one twin, plus the same thing for B
#
# where P(T|A) = 0.1 and P(T|B) = 0.2
#
# and P(A|T1) and P(B|T1) are posterior probabilities, so:
# P(A|T1) ~ P(T|A) * P(A) with equal priors = 0.1 * 1/2
# P(B|T1) ~ P(T|B) * P(B) = 0.2 * 1/2
# After standardization: 1/3 and 2/3
#
# Plugging these posteriors in the equation above gives 1 chance out of 6 that
# the female has another pair of twins

### Exercise 2H2 ####

# Prob. that panda is A given it had twins already is P(A|T1) = 1/3 (see above)

#### Exercise 2H3 ####

# T: number of twin births
# N: number of births
# P(A|T = 1, N = 2): prob. A given one twin event out of two births
# prop. to P(T = 1, N = 2|A) * P(A)
# where prior P(A) = P(A|T = 1, N = 1), i.e. posterior from after observing
# the first birth = 1/3
# and where P(T = 1, N = 2|A) = 0.1 * (1 - 0.1) = 0.09
# To normalize we need P(T = 1, N = 2|B) * P(B) = 0.2 * (1 - 0.2) * 2/3 = 0.107
# So normalizing constant is 0.09 * 1/3 + 0.107 = 0.137
# And P(A|T = 1, N = 2) = 0.09 * 1/3 / 0.137 = 0.219

#### Exercise 2H4 ####

# Ignoring births, compute P(A|test says A)
