In this repo I upload my progress in following the course on Bayesian inference by [Richard McElreath](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/) called [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WVelCswXo4&list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI), with exercises from his book. The scripts for the exercises are in `scripts` and the generated figures are in `results`.
